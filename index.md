### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 1 was definitely one of my favorites because I was super excited to learn how to code. I was able to finally start to code and do my first coding assignment so it was definitely a great experience. I learned how to clone a repository and make changes to it.

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 2 was also one of my favorites due to the fact of how much we learned during the lab. I went into part 2 not knowing anything about what we had to do so actually completing it was something that made me proud. I learned how to write a code that included and used input ,output, arithmetic operators, variables and etc.
    
* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was my favorite mainly due to the fact it was about blackjack hands. I actually enjoy playing blackjack and even play sometimes at the San Manuel casino.In this part of the lab I learned how to write a function correlating to a blackjack hand.
